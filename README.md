# .NET Components Example
Two components demonstrating .NET component interaction:
- **Dog.dll** - Class library implementing IDog interface
- **Host.exe** - Console app using Dog component

## Architecture
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- **IDog interface** - Defines dog behaviours:
    - *Core*: Bark, Growl, Bite, Run, WagTail
    - *Others*: DemandFood, LiftLeg
- **Dog class** - Implements dog behaviours
- **IFeeder** - Feeding responsibilities *(GiveFood, GiveDrink, Call)*
- **IDogHost** - Care responsibilities *(LeadAnimal, CareForAnimalFur)*
- **Host** class implements both interfaces
- **Program** - Main entry point with demonstration

## Build & Run
```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the host application
dotnet run --project Host
```
